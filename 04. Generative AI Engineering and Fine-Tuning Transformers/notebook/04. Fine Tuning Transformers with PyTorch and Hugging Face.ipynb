Fine-tuning enables BERT to learn from a smaller labeled dataset and generalize well to unseen examples, making it a powerful tool for various natural language processing tasks. It helps to bridge the gap between pretraining on a large corpus and the specific requirements of downstream applications, ultimately improving the performance and effectiveness of models in various real-world scenarios.\n"

The function processes the data in batches for each epoch, which involves several steps for each batch: transferring the data to the correct device (like a GPU), running the data through the model to get outputs and calculate loss, updating the model's parameters using the calculated gradients, adjusting the learning rate, and clearing the old gradients. These steps are repeated for each batch of data, and the progress bar is updated accordingly to reflect the progress. Once all epochs are completed, the trained model is saved to be used later.\n",

Please use examples related to potential monopsonies in the labour market and cite relevant research.### Assistant: \"Monopsony\" refers to a market structure where there is only one buyer for a particular good or service. In economics, this term is particularly relevant in the labor market, where a monopsony employer has significant power over the wages and working conditions of their employees. The presence of a monopsony can result in lower wages and reduced employment opportunities for workers, as the employer has little incentive to increase wages or provide better working conditions.\\n\\nRecent research has identified potential monopsonies in industries such as retail and fast food, where a few large companies control a significant portion of the market (Bivens & Mishel, 2013). In these industries, workers often face low wages, limited benefits, and reduced bargaining power, leading to a situation where they are dependent on the employer for their livelihood. This dependence can result in further suppression of wages and a decline in working conditions.\\n\\nOverall, the concept of monopsony is essential to understanding the dynamics of labor markets and the impact of market power on workers. Further research is needed to understand the extent and impact of monopsonies on the economy and to develop policies to address this issue.\\n\\nReferences:\\nBivens, J., & Mishel, L. (2013).
